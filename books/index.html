A Daoist Journey into China: journal of a voyage into the interior (2012) The culmination of 50 years of Zen meditation set against a 10,000 mile unescorted trip to China in 1987, when tinkling bicycles in the streets—no cars, no high rises and everyone earning the same $20 wage—were the norms. On a meditational journey that took him to temples and monasteries, Schwartz seeks to describe the experience of meditation from the ‘inside.’" />
